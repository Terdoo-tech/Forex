I love to trade on the forex market!
Do you love to trade the forex?
Yes I do. Thanks for asking.

How do I read market trend? Could you teach me please?
okay then, that's not a problem.
First you need to understand that there are two major trends on the forex market. Namely;sell trend and buy trend. You also need to know that there will be times when the market will take neither of the positions. We refer to this as a ranging trend. It moves sideways.
